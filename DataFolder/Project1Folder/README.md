# Project1Data

This folder contains scripts demonstrating how I handle persistent player data in Roblox, specifically for a pet inventory system.

## Files

- `Project1Data.lua` – script handling player data (speed, wins, rebirths) and pet Data
- `petModule.lua` – Module script that handles pet logic (equipping, GUI updates, etc.).

## Description
This feature demonstrates my ability to manage player data, including inventory, equipped items, and unique identifiers. It works alongside other modules to ensure gameplay mechanics are synced with stored data.

## Notes
- Demonstrates handling persistent player data using Roblox DataStores.  
- Shows ability to structure and manage player-specific data (inventory, equipped pets, unique IDs).  
- Implements modular interaction with other scripts (e.g., `petModule`) for spawning and managing gameplay elements.  
- Highlights safe use of `pcall` to handle errors when loading or saving data.  
- Organized to be reusable and easily integrated into other projects that require player data management.
