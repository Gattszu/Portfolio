# Shop Feature

This folder contains scripts demonstrating a Roblox shop feature using dev products/gamepasses.

## Files

- `WinsShopScript.lua` – Main script that handles the win shop logic.
- `SpeedShopScript.lua` – Main script that handles the speed shop logic.
- `DevProductHandler.lua` – Handles dev product purchases from both shops.

## Notes

- This feature demonstrates my ability to implement dev products and modular, integratable scripts.
- Roblox handles the purchase confirmation and currency validation.
