# Pet System

This folder contains MOST of the scripts demonstrating the pet System I have implemented.

## Files

- `Inventory.lua` – Module Script holding self contained subroutines that locally handles the player inventory
- `SpeedShopScript.lua` – Module Script holding scripts that handles all pet logic predominantly on the server
- `ProcessEggRoll.lua` – Server script that listens for a player to hatch an egg and handles all following operations
- `PetServer.lua` – Server script that handles pet operations that must take place via the server 
## Note

- This is a standalone pet system demonstrating end-to-end functionality, including inventory management, egg hatching, and server-side pet operations.
- Highlights modular and clean scripting practices that make the system easy to integrate into other projects.
- Showcases my ability to work with Roblox dev products and implement core gameplay mechanics.
- Designed to be reusable and adaptable for other game features.
